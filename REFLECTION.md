# Reflection for my Join a cricket team form

## 1. What does my code do?
- My code validates a cricket club sign-up form before submission. It checks if all required fields are filled and if they meet specific criteria, such as format for the player code. Error messages are displayed dynamically, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

## 2. What was my coding process?
- I started by building the HTML form structure, followed by applying CSS for layout. Then, I added JavaScript validation with modular functions for error handling. I ensured accessibility and keyboard navigation to meet WCAG standards, testing the form iteratively. I also checked a color contrasts using axe Devtools.

## 3. What challenges did I have?
- I encountered challenges with accessibility, such as ensuring proper screen reader support, and handling form validation for multiple input types (text, checkboxes, radio buttons). I researched best practices to solve these issues and tested the form extensively using axe Devtools and w3c validator.

## 4. What would I do differently?
- I would refactoring the code to be more modular which will help with maintenance. Improving aria-labels and contrast ratios will enhance accessibility, which is really important. Using automated testing will also ensure compatibility across different platforms.
